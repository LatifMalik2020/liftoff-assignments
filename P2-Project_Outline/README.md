### Overview
Include overview here:
This project allows graphic artists, as well as others, to upload low (ability to display or measure very small things) images using drag-and-drop abilities to our website to be fancy into bright and sharp images. These higher visual sharpness images can be used in marketing ads, 2D video game fairies, or for non-commercial purposes, such as reaching a better quality image from a low resolution photo of friends or family.
### Features
Include Features here:

the website will allow users to create an account that will allow them to securely login and access the images they've uploaded, as well as their fancy copies. Users can then organize their images by sorting them into project categories or folders, deleting no longer useful/no longer used files, and searching their images by name or date. User images will be securely stored in a (computer file full of information) for only (identity is verified) users to access. Also, users will get an email or SMS notice/communication once their uploaded images have been fancy, which will contain a link to the image within their secure user account on our website
